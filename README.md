The AI-Powered Mental Health Support Chatbot is an innovative solution designed to address the pressing mental health challenges faced by individuals in Africa. This project leverages artificial intelligence to provide accessible, anonymous, and immediate support to users seeking mental health assistance. By utilizing a conversational interface, the chatbot aims to reduce stigma around mental health issues and encourage individuals to seek help when needed.
Problem Statement:

Mental health disorders are prevalent in many regions across Africa, yet access to professional mental health services remains limited due to various barriers, including stigma, lack of resources, and geographical constraints. Many individuals suffer in silence, unable to find the support they need. This project seeks to bridge that gap by offering a digital platform for immediate assistance and information.
Objectives:
To create a user-friendly chatbot that provides 24/7 support for individuals experiencing mental health challenges.
To educate users about mental health issues and available resources.

To increase awareness of mental health resources available in their local communities.
Key Features:
Conversational Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot in natural language, making it easy to express their feelings and concerns.
Resource Database: The chatbot provides users with information about local mental health resources, hotlines, and counseling services.
Immediate Support: The chatbot is available at all times, allowing users to seek help whenever they need it without fear of judgment.
Anonymity and Privacy: Users can engage with the chatbot anonymously, promoting a safe space for discussing sensitive topics.
Educational Content: The chatbot offers information on common mental health issues, coping strategies, and self-care tips.
Technology Stack:
Backend Framework: Flask (Python) for building the web application and handling API requests.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Basic keyword matching for understanding user input and generating responses.
Deployment: The application can be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS for wider accessibility.
Target Audience:
The primary audience includes individuals seeking mental health support in Africa, particularly those who may be hesitant to reach out for help due to stigma or lack of access to services.
